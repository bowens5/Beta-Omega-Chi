# Beta-Omega-Chi Website

This repository now contains a React implementation of the Social Club site. The
original static HTML files remain for reference, but the main app is located in
the `react-app` folder and was bootstrapped with Create React App.

The application provides a login page and a simple personal calendar powered by
`localStorage`.

## Running the React app

```bash
cd react-app
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the site at
`http://localhost:3000`.

## Legacy files

The original static files are kept in the repository:
- `index.html`
- `login.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

These are no longer used by the React app but demonstrate the previous static
implementation.
